<h1>About Me</h1>
<hr />
<p>
  My name is Jessica, and I’m originally from Richmond, Virginia. Growing up, I
  aspired to become a doctor, which led me to pursue nursing courses and earn my
  CNA certification. After high school, I worked as a Certified Nursing
  Assistant for two years. However, during that time, and thanks to my dad, I
  discovered my true passion lies in astronomy—the study of space and the stars.

  When I was 17, my parents and I took a road trip to Arizona to visit the Grand
  Canyon. While there, family friends mentioned that Arizona State University
  (ASU) has strong ties with NASA and a renowned astronomy program. After
  deciding to pursue a career in astronomy, I initially applied to a university
  in Virginia but was not accepted. Recalling our trip to Arizona, I decided to
  apply to ASU instead. My dad and I toured the campus, and within a week of
  applying, I was accepted. Two weeks after the tour, I made the move to Arizona
  to begin my journey.

  I graduated from ASU in May 2024. While my love for space remains strong, I
  realized that the Astrophysics program wasn’t the right fit for me, as it was
  more focused on physics than astronomy. When I first applied to the school in
  Virginia, I was told that "astronomy isn’t a real degree" and that
  Astrophysics would be the best path for graduate school. After eight grueling
  years in college, I’ve decided to pursue a career in programming instead. I’ve
  discovered that I pick it up quickly and feel genuinely excited when writing
  code. And now here I am, working on my first HTML project.
